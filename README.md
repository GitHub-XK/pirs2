# README #

Originally, PIRS and co has been stored on the INR's internal SVN server. The use of files outside the KIT network was complicated since the SVN server is accessible only from within the KIT network. Since there is no current activity (and interest) in INR, I copied all filed to this private repository that is accessible from everywhere.

All changes to PIRS should be made here, the version on the INR's SVN server should not be changed anymore.

There are several folders on the original SVN server that were not copied here: brunches, tags.
