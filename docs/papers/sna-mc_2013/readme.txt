doc_abstract -- text for the abstract written in rst. Final version of pdf was generated by window's distutils, therefore I assume that this rst was used only as the first step and final tuning was done in word.

Folder with slides is in `talks`, while I prepared slides for several talks (SNA-MC, INR seminar, Obninsk conference) in one folder.
